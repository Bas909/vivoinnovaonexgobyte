Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Vivoinnovaonexgobyte is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Vivoinnovaonexgobyte uses peer-to-peer

 This package provides the daemon, vivoinnovaonexgobyted, and the CLI tool
 vivoinnovaonexgobyte-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Vivoinnovaonexgobyte is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Vivoinnovaonexgobyte Core

 This package provides vivoinnovaonexgobyte-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a vivoinnovaonexgobyte daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
